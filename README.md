1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
<br/>
No because it is vague, to test this, you would need like a real person so test and use the program directly using the message feature
2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
<br/>
Yes I would use a unit test to test the max message length because we can just make a unit test to test the length of the string to be over some value like if length is bigger than 80, it should be false, and less than 80 it should be true
